# A guide for setting up your DS Flashcart - more commonly known as R4 Carts

This site covers how to set up your DS Flashcard, as well as some basic troubleshooting steps if your cart isn't working correctly!
I also cover some Timebomb misconceptions which can be seen here: [https://flashcarts.deletecat.com/timebomb.html](https://flashcarts.deletecat.com/timebomb.html)

## Note: This site will not include download links to pirated ROMs

Dump your games yourself, or consider trying some homebrew roms instead!

## How to get help for your cart

If:

* You can't identify your cart and/or it's missing from the cart lists
* Instructions to set up your cart did not work
* Troubleshooting steps did not work;

You can ask for help in these places:

* Mastodon (@Deletecat@mas.to) - This is my mastodon account, feel free to DM me with your problem!
* Lemmy (!flashcarts@lemmy.dbzer0.com) - I moved here after deleting my reddit account, feel free to post here, although it's not as big as the next option;
* Reddit (r/flashcarts) - This subreddit has a fairly big community, there will likely be someone who can help!
* Github Issues - Make an issue here!
