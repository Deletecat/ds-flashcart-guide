    <h1>DSOne SDHC / DSOnei / DSOnei Mini - EvolutionOS</h1>
    <p>
        Unlike the DSOne, both the DSOne SDHC and DSOnei are not limited to 2GB micro SD cards! 
        EvolutionOS comes with great game compatibility, as well as extra features like Real-Time Saving (RTS) and Game Slowdown.<br/><br/>
        The DSOne SDHC sometimes has issues with dead PSRAM. Especially the DSOne SDHC clones you can buy online nowadays.
        The next section will cover how to test this on your cart. 
        I don't know if this issue applies to the DSOnei - I do know, however, that the self-test feature is not present on DSOnei/Mini carts.<br/><br/>
        Even if the PSRAM is dead, you can still use the cart with YSMenu, however you will miss out on EvolutionOS' special features.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How to test if your PSRAM is dead</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>DSOne self-test</li>
        <ul>
            <li>While holding L+R+UP, launch the cart.</li>
            <li>This should take you to a screen saying Test Flash, press A twice to test the PSRAM then wait for the process to complete.</li>
            <li>If you got the message saying 'psram ok!', you are free to carry on with this guide.</li>
            <li>If you got the message saying 'psram error!', <a href="../ysmenu/ysmenu_dsone_i.html">click here to be taken to the YSMenu guide</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Game test</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow the instructions below to setup EvolutionOS</li>
            <li>Put a .nds ROM onto your micro SD card, then launch it</li>
            <li>If the game launches correctly, you can keep EvolutionOS</li>
            <li>If games refuse to launch, delete all of the files on the micro SD card, then <a href="../ysmenu/ysmenu_dsone_i.html">click here to be taken to the YSMenu guide</a></li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Installation is simple:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Download the kernel from here: <a href="https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/SuperCard/DSONE_SDHC_DSONEi/SuperCard_DSONE_SDHC_EOS_sp6_20121206.zip">flashcard-archive link</a></li>
        <li>Extract it with your preferred file extractor</li>
        <li>Copy the extracted kernel files to the root of your micro SD card</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>DSOne Manual</h3>
    <p>Sanras made a great manual on how to use the DSOne, you can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/Sanrax/DSOneManual">GitHub link</a></p>
    
    <h3>DSOnei Firmware Update</h3>
    <p>
        You can update the firmware of the DSOnei to launch it on unhacked DSi consoles on firmware version 1.4.5!
        Note that this tool will not work on a regular DSOne or DSOne SDHC. 
        You can find the download here: <a href="https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/SuperCard/DSONE_SDHC_DSONEi/SuperCard_DSONEi_FWUpdate_1.4.5.nds">flashcard-archive link</a>
        <br/><br/> This does not work on the "DSOnei" carts on AliExpress. These are normal DSOne SDHC clones with a DSOnei sticker to make them more presentable.
    </p>
