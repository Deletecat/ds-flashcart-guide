    <h1>3dslink.com's Blue Cart</h1>
    <p>
        The 3dslink carts (red and blue) were gateway3ds clones. 
        The blue cart let you play DS games.
        The red cart let you play 3DS games!
        <br/>
        To be able to use the red cart, you had to use the blue cart to launch the exploit.
        This exploit works on firmware versions between 4.1.0 and 4.5.0, meaning you cannot use the red cart on newer firmware versions.
        The red cart is obsolete thanks to Custom Firmware (CFW), you can find a guide to install CFW here: <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">3ds.hacks.guide</a>
        <br/><br/>
        This page takes you through setting up the blue cart instead. 
    </p>
    <h3>Installation is simple</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Download the 3dslink kernel from here: <a href="https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/3dslink.com/3dslink.com_Blue_Kernel_1.64.zip">flashcard-archive link</a></li>
        <li>Extract it using your preferred file extractor</li>
        <li>Copy the kernel files to the root of your micro SD card</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="warning">! > Older versions of the red cart firmware are known to <b>brick</b> 3DS consoles, <i>you can thank gateway3ds for that...</i></p>
