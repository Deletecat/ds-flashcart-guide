# DS Flashcard guide

Welcome to the DS Flashcard guide! This is a project started by me, [Deletecat](https://deletecat.com), which should help you get started using your DS Cart (or more commonly known as R4 cards!)

I will be slowly building on this site over the next few months to try and include as many carts as possible. However, I cannot do this alone! If you would like to contribute, please visit the github page for this site by clicking the octocat in the top right corner :)

## Getting started

To get started, all you need is your flashcard, [a compatible micro SD card](http://localhost:3000/#/?id=sd-cards), and a few minutes of your time. These carts usually do not take a long time to set up, though with some carts you may have to try a few kernels until you get one that works!

### SD Cards

Most DS Carts are SDHC compatible, there are some carts (notably the Original R4) that only support up to 2GB micro Sd cards

You won't be left in the dark about this, on pages where are cart is limited to 2gb micro sd cards, you will see the this:

> This cart only supports micro SD cards up to 2GB in capacity

Your micro SD card has to be formatted as Fat32 in order for it to work on these DS carts. Carts that do not have a 2GB limit can use micro SD cards that are up to 2TB in capacity when formatted correctly. Though, personally, anything above 32GB is excessive. DS ROMs are small so you do not need massive micro SD cards

!> Warning about Fake/Cheap Micro SD Cards (or storage in general) 

I would suggest buying your micro SD cards in stores instead of marketplaces like Amazon*\. I say this because there are many fake micro SD cards online, just search '1TB micro sd card' on marketplaces like Amazon and AliExpress to see what I mean. "High Capacity" micro SD cards that are somehow cheaper than name brands. **DO NOT** trust these micro SD cards, they are a lower capacity than what they claim. Even if you could figure out the capacity, still not a good idea to trust them seeing as they are usually QC rejects.

Sometimes you may see, for example, a 32GB micro SD card that's cheaper than the rest. If it's generic or from a brand you have never heard of, **DO NOT BUY IT**. A lot of the time these SD cards are produced cheaply, they will fail within weeks or months. These are also the micro SD cards that are being bundled with the DS cards. If you recieve a micro SD card with your DS Cart, throw it away.

Always stick to name brands like SanDisk, Samsung Evo, Kingston, etc. They produce high quality micro SD cards that should last for as long as you use the cart

** Some stores *cough Walmart cough* do sell some of their marketplace items in store. Be careful, if it's cheap and high capacity, it's probably fake. 

#### Formatting your SD card

To format and test your micro SD card, I usually recommend the instructions found here: [https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html](https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html) This takes you through properly formatting and testing your micro SD card based on which operating system you use, can't recommend it enough :)

### Recommended software

Here is the software that I'd recommend using to extract your carts kernel:

- [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) (Windows) - 7-Zip is a file archiver that is free and open source!
- [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) (MacOS) - File extractor for Mac OS, much better than Archive Utility in my opinion!
- [PeaZip](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/) (Windows/MacOS/Linux) - Similar to 7-Zip, PeaZip is a file archiver that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. While I prefer 7-Zip, it's free and open source!

If you are using linux, most of the time a file extractor will be included with your distro, I'd recommend using that instead

I do not recommend using WinRAR - yes, it's technically free as it doesn't force you to pay - why bother using it in the first place when there are better foss alternatives?

### Piracy Disclaimer

I have not, and will not, promote piracy on this site. This site is intended to setup your DS Flashcart, not to download ROMs. There are other sites dedicated to ROMs and Piracy. **This is not one of them**.
