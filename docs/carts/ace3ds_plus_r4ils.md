# Ace3ds+ / R4iLS / clones

The list of carts that this page applies to can be found [here](https://gitHub.com/ds-homebrew/flashcard-archive), though I'll copy-paste them here too:
* Ace3DS+
* Ace3DS X
* \#\#\# in 1 combo cart
* Unlabelled cart with a red PCB - Note: There are different types of unlabelled red cart, see here to differentiate between them: (URL PLACEHOLDER)
* r4isdhc.com.cn carts
* r4isdhc.hk 2020+ carts
* r4li.com carts
* r4infinity.com 2
* r4ixds.com 2014 white version
* woodr4isdhc.com carts

These carts will use the Ace3ds+ wood 1.62, this is not r4 wood 1.62.
Ace3ds+ wood 1.62 is based on an old version of R4 wood, it's not based on R4 wood 1.62 as the name might suggest. 
It is missing some anti-piracy patches but nonetheless is good for game compatibility!
