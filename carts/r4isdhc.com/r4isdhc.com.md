## RTS Lite with no year number

Remember what I said about 2014-2021 carts being the only carts (by r4isdhc.com) to use YSMenu. Well, that's not 100% true. This cart will use YSMenu too!

!> This section does **not** include the RTS Lite "New" carts, see the previous section on how to set those carts up.

The cart should look like this:

Make sure that this is what your cart looks like before proceeding.

1. Download Retrogamefan's multicart update from gbatemp: [https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/](https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/)
2. Extract the multicart's .7z archive to your downloads folder
3. Go into the multicart folder, then into the DSTTi Clone YSMenu folder
4. Copy every file in this folder to the root of your micro SD card.
5. Make a copy of TTMenu.dat, then rename the copy to R4.dat

## Christmas Edition

I find this cart funny, not with any weird software or anything, just the idea of a "Christmas Edition" makes me laugh a little

The cart should look like this:

Make sure that this is what your cart looks like before proceeding.

1. Download the "Christmas" kernel from the flashcard archive: [https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/YSMenu/r4isdhc.com/r4isdhc.com_Christmas_Edition_Limited_SDHC_Kernel_1.17B.zip](https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/YSMenu/r4isdhc.com/r4isdhc.com_Christmas_Edition_Limited_SDHC_Kernel_1.17B.zip)
2. Extract the kernel to the micro SD card
3. Next, download Retrogamefan's multicart update from gbatemp: [https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/](https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/)
4. Extract the multicart's .7z archive to your downloads folder
5. Go into the multicart folder, then into the R4 Clone YSMenu folder.
6. Copy every file in this folder to the root of your micro SD card
7. When you launch your cart, open YSMenu.nds!

You can use the "Christmas" kernel as is, but YSMenu is newer which is why I suggest using it. Every time you boot your cart, you will have to open YSMenu.nds to boot into YSMenu.

## Original r4isdhc.com

This looks like the r4i-sdhc.com carts, but instead of r4i-sdhc.com, it has r4isdhc.com written on it.

This is what the cart looks like:

Make sure that this is what your cart looks like before proceeding.

This is very simple, just download the kernel from the flashcard archive: [https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/r4isdhc.com/r4isdhc.com_Original_Kernel_1.19B.zip](https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/r4isdhc.com/r4isdhc.com_Original_Kernel_1.19B.zip)

Then extract it to the root of your micro sd card. I do not think this cart supports YSMenu, so this is the most up to date kernel you could use unfortunately. And after talking with someone who has this cart, game compatibility isn't fantastic either.

## r4isdhc.com RTS Black

This cart can also use YSMenu thanks to lifehackerhansol, see this page for more details: [https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-itouchds-complete-kernel-replacement.607421/](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-itouchds-complete-kernel-replacement.607421/)
