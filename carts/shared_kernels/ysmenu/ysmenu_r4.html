    <h1>YSMenu - Original R4 and it's clones</h1>
    <p>
        This version of YSMenu is intended to be used as a 'dual boot' setup.
        This means that these carts boot into their own kernel first, before loading into YSMenu.
    </p>
    <p class="sd-notice">Some of these carts only support microSD cards up to 2 GB in capacity. I would suggest sticking with the stock kernel if this is the case for your cart.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of supported carts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Original R4 - Only supports up to 2GB microSD cards</li>
        <li>R4-III (r4iiinew.com)</li>
        <li>All carts from r4-pro.com</li>
        <li>R4-III (r4dsl.net)</li>
        <li>N5 (dsn5.com)</li>
        <li>R4iNDSiXL (r4indsill.com)</li>
        <li>R4 SDHC Christmas Edition (only this cart, other r4isdhc.com carts may brick) (r4isdhc.com)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Installation is simple</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow the instructions on the previous page to get your cart's stock kernel working.</li>
        <li>Download RetroGameFan's multicart update from here: <a href="https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/download">GBATemp Link</a></li>
        <li>Extract it using your preferred file extractor</li>
        <li>Go into the R4 Clone YSMenu folder</li>
        <li>Copy every file from this folder to the root of your micro SD card!</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Booting into YSMenu</h4>
    <p>
        You will notice that upon booting your cart, you will be in your carts stock kernel rather than YSMenu.<br/>
        Not to fear though, all you have to do once you've booted your cart is to launch YSMenu.nds!<br/> 
        You have to do this every time you boot your cart though so keep that in mind.
    </p>
