    <h1>Acekard.cc - Acekard 3</h1>
    <p>
        This is a weird cart, it's the Acekard 3! Is it affiliated with the original acekard team?
        <br/><br/>Nope. <br/>I can't find much about the cart other than listings from a bunch of polish websites that used to sell them.
        <i>Were these fakes made in Poland?</i>
        <br/>Most information I can find is on GBATemp where most of the posts are pointing out that it's a fake.
        Either way, it will use AKAIO 1.8.7 as it's kernel!
    </p>
    <h3>Installation is simple</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Download AKAIO 1.8.7 from here: <a href="https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/acekard.cc/acekard.cc_Acekard_3_AKAIO_1.8.7.zip">flashcard-archive link</a></li>
        <li>Extract it using your preferred file extractor</li>
        <li>Copy the extracted kernel files to the root of your micro SD card</li>
    </ul>
