<h1>DS Flashcard guide</h1>

Welcome to the DS Flashcard guide! This is a project started by me, [Deletecat](https://deletecat.com), which should help you get started using your DS Cart (or more commonly known as R4 cards!)

<h2><b>As of right now, this is a work on progress, there are no guides on this site as of yet</b></h2>

I will be slowly building on this site over the next few months to try and include as many carts as possible. However, I cannot do this alone! If you would like to contribute, please visit the github page for this site by clicking the octocat in the top right corner :)

## Getting started

To get started, all you need is your flashcard, [a compatible micro SD card](http://localhost:3000/#/?id=sd-cards), and a few minutes of your time. These carts usually do not take a long time to set up, though with some carts you may have to try a few kernels until you get one that works!

### SD Cards

Most DS Carts are SDHC compatible, there are some carts (notably the Original R4) that only support up to 2GB micro Sd cards

You won't be left in the dark about this, on pages where are cart is limited to 2gb micro sd cards, you will see the this:

> This cart only supports micro SD cards up to 2GB in capacity

Your micro SD card has to be formatted as Fat32 in order for it to work on these DS carts. Carts that do not have a 2GB limit can use micro SD cards that are up to 2TB in capacity when formatted correctly. Though, personally, anything above 32GB is excessive. DS ROMs are small so you do not need massive micro SD cards

!> Warning about Fake/Cheap Micro SD Cards (or storage in general)

I would suggest buying your micro SD cards in stores instead of marketplaces like Amazon. I say this because there are many fake micro SD cards online. "High Capacity" micro SD cards that are somehow cheaper than name brands. **DO NOT** trust these micro SD cards, they are a lower capacity than what they claim. Even if you could figure out the capacity, still not a good idea to trust them, I feel as though [this video](https://youtu.be/HFY5hd273lI) is great at explaining why. It was made a few years ago, the information is still up to date in 2023. In very rare cases, these fake storage devices contain malware. If it looks too good to be true, don't buy it

Sometimes you may see, for example, a 32GB micro SD card that's cheaper than the rest. A lot of the time, these are real micro SD cards. But they are slow, I wouldn't suggest buying them if you can. I would also stay away from generic micro SD cards, if a company doesn't attach their name to a product, it's likely a terrible product

Always stick to name brands like SanDisk. Even if the name brand SD cards are more expensive than the other offerings on these marketplaces, the quality is guaranteed most of the time. I avoid marketplaces when buying storage devices as you never know whether the seller you are buying from will give you a genuine product or not. Call me paranoid, but I'd rather have the gaurantee that my storage has come from the brand it claims to be

!> Some stores *cough Walmart cough* have sold some of their marketplace items in store. Be careful, if it's cheap and high capacity, it's probably fake

#### Formatting your SD card

To format and test your micro SD card, I usually recommend the instructions found here: [https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html](https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html) This takes you through properly formatting and testing your micro SD card based on which operating system you use, can't recommend it enough :)

### Recommended software

Here is the software that I'd recommend using to extract your carts kernel:

- [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) (Windows) - 7-Zip is a file archiver that is free and open source!
- [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) (MacOS) - File extractor for Mac OS, much better than Archive Utility in my opinion!
- [PeaZip](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/) (Windows/MacOS/Linux) - Similar to 7-Zip, PeaZip is a file archiver that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. While I prefer 7-Zip, PeaZip is also free and open source!

If you are using linux, most of the time a file extractor will be included with your distro, I'd recommend using that instead

?> I do not recommend using WinRAR - yes, it's technically free as it doesn't force you to pay - why bother using it in the first place when there are better FOSS alternatives?

### Piracy Disclaimer

I have not, and will not, promote piracy on this site. This site is intended to setup your DS Flashcart, not to download ROMs. There are other sites dedicated to ROMs and Piracy. **This is not one of them**.

## Identifying your cart

Now we are onto the important section of this guide, identifying your cart.

A simple question, does your cart have a label with the manufacturers website name on it?

- [Cart has a label with a website name](website.md)
- [Cart has a label without a website name](no_website.md)
- [No label or website name on the cart](no_label.md)

### Dates

Since I live in Europe, I will format any dates as dd/mm/yyyy. I'm sorry if this may confuse you
