    <h1>DS Flashcard guide</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the DS Flashcard guide! This is a project started by me, <a href="https://deletecat.com">Deletecat</a>, 
        which should <i>hopefully</i> help to set up your DS flashcard to play games and use Homebrew!
    </p>

    <p>If you would like to help contribute, <a href="https://github.com/Deletecat/ds-flashcart-guide" id="Github">click here to visit the Github Repository for the site!</a></p>
    
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>
        To get started, all you need is your flashcard, <a href="https://flashcarts.deletecat.com/#sd-cards">a compatible microSD card</a>, and a few minutes of your time. 
        These carts do not take a long time to set up, though with some carts you may have to try a few kernels until you find one that works!
    </p>

    <p> 
        If you are looking to buy a cart, see the flashcart wiki's quick start guide here: <a href="https://flashcarts.net/ds-quick-start-guide">flashcarts.net</a> - 
        make sure to read through all of the cart descriptions to choose the right one for your console.
        <br/><br/><i>If you are on a DSi or 3DS, consider installing custom firmware (CFW) instead:</i>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://dsi.cfw.guide">https://dsi.cfw.guide</a> - Guide for installing Twilight Menu ++ and Unlaunch</li>
            <li><a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">https://3ds.hacks.guide</a> - Guide for installing Luma3ds - Download Twilight menu ++ from universal updater after installation</li>
        </ul>
        <i>If you get an error message (An error has occurred...) when trying to use your cart, this should fix it! CFW is free and easy to install, I would highly recommend doing so</i>
    </p>
    <h3 id="sd-cards">SD Cards</h3>
    <p>Most DS flashcarts are SDHC compatible, there are some carts that only support up to 2GB microSD cards - like the original R4</p>
    <p>For carts that only support 2GB microSD cards, you should see this message on their page:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="sd-notice">This cart only supports microSD cards up to 2GB in capacity</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        DS Flashcarts are usually picky about the way their microSD cards are formatted. Here is a guide on how to properly format the microSD card for use in these flashcarts:
        <a href="https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html">dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html</a><br/>
        On flashcarts that do not have a 2GB limit, you can use up to 2TB capacity microSD cards. This is quite excessive though, DS ROMs are small so we would recommend 32GB microSDHC cards instead.
    </p>

    <p class="warning">! &gt; Warning about Fake/Cheap Micro SD Cards (or storage in general)</p>
    <p>I would suggest buying your micro SD cards in stores, instead of online marketplaces like AliExpress / Amazon / eBay / Temu / Wish / etc.</p>
    
    <p>
        I say this because there are many fake micro SD cards online. 
        “High Capacity” micro SD cards that are somehow cheaper than name brands. 
        <strong>DO NOT</strong> trust these micro SD cards, they are a lower capacity than what they claim. 
        You might already know this, but others do not. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if you could figure out the capacity, it’s still not a good idea to trust them, I feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/HFY5hd273lI">this video</a> is great at explaining why. 
        It was made a few years ago, <strong>the information is still up-to-date in 2023!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Always stick to big name brands like SanDisk. 
        If you have to buy your micro SD card from a marketplace,  make sure that you are buying from an official seller to reduce your chances of receiving a fake SD card.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
        ! &gt; Sometimes stores like Walmart will sell some of their marketplace items in-store, if its high capacity and very cheap, do not trust it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are buying a flashcart, don't buy one with an included/pre-loaded microSD card.
        These SD cards are made to be cheap, they will fail on you within weeks and all of your data will be gone.
        They are also more expensive than buying the cart on it's own. Save yourself the hassle and buy them on their own.
    </p>
    <h3>Recommended software</h3>
    <p> Here is the software that I would recommend installing before following the guide for your carts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://7-zip.org">7-Zip</a> (Windows) - 
            7-Zip is a file archiver that is free and open source!</li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://theunarchiver.com/">The Unarchiver</a> (MacOS) -
            File extractor for Mac OS, much better than Archive Utility in my opinion!
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/">PeaZip</a> (Windows/MacOS/Linux) - 
            Similar to 7-Zip, PeaZip is a file archiver that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux - it's also free and open source! 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you are using Linux, most of the time a file extractor will be included with your distro, I’d recommend using that instead.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
        ! &gt; I do not recommend using WinRAR or Archive Utility for extracting your kernel files.
    </p>

    <h3>Piracy Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        I have not, and will not, promote piracy on this site. 
        This site is intended to set up your DS Flashcard, not to download ROMs. 
        There are other sites dedicated to pirated ROMs. 
    </p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h2>Timebomb Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>
        Timebombs aren't as harmful as some people make them out to be.

    <p class="warning">
      This site is still a work in progress (unfortunately), though pages for some carts are complete!
