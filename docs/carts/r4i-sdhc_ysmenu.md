## Installation

1. Download Retrogamefan's multicart update from gbatemp: [https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/](https://gbatemp.net/download/retrogamefan-multi-cart-update.35737/)
2. Extract it
3. Go into the R4i-SDHC YSMenu folder
4. Copy every file in this folder to the root of your micro SD card

### Special Cases

In some cases, your cart may not boot after correctly installing YSMenu. To make it boot, you will have to use a different bootloader!

The carts which may require this are:

- r4i-sdhc.com carts
- r4i-gold.eu carts
- r4i-gold.com carts
- r4imax.com carts
- r4isdhc.com carts

Only install the bootloader if your cart does not boot into YSMenu (and is still showing the ?menu message)

#### Installing the different bootloader

To install the different bootloader:

- Download the bootloader from here: [https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/YSMenu/DEMON_common/R4.dat](https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/YSMenu/DEMON_common/R4.dat)
- Put it onto your micro SD card, overwrite/replace when asked
