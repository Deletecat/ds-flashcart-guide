<h1>DS Flashcard guide</h1>

Welcome to the DS Flashcard guide! This is a project started by me, [Deletecat](https://deletecat.com), which should *hopefully* help to set up your DS Cart to play games and use Homebrew!

**This site is a work in progress!**

If you would like to help contribute to this site, click the Octocat in the top-right corner!

## Getting started

To get started, all you need is your flashcard, [a compatible micro SD card](https://flashcarts.deletecat.com/#/?id=sd-cards), and a few minutes of your time. These carts do not take a long time to set up, though with some carts you may have to try a few kernels until you find one that works!

### SD Cards

Most DS Carts are SDHC compatible, there are some carts that only support up to 2 GB micro SD cards - like the original R4

For carts that only support 2 GB micro SD cards, you should see this message on their page:

> This cart only supports micro SD cards up to 2 GB in capacity

Your micro SD card has to be formatted as Fat32 in order for it to work on these DS carts. Carts that do not have the 2 GB limit can use micro SD cards that are up to 2 TB in capacity when formatted correctly. Though, personally, anything above 32 GB is excessive. DS ROMs are small, so you do not need massive micro SD cards

!> Warning about Fake/Cheap Micro SD Cards (or storage in general)

I would suggest buying your micro SD cards in stores instead of marketplaces like Amazon.

I say this because there are many fake micro SD cards online. "High Capacity" micro SD cards that are somehow cheaper than name brands. **DO NOT** trust these micro SD cards, they are a lower capacity than what they claim.

Even if you could figure out the capacity, it's still not a good idea to trust them, I feel as though [this video](https://youtu.be/HFY5hd273lI) is great at explaining why. It was made a few years ago, **the information is still up-to-date in 2023**. In very rare cases, these fake storage devices contain malware. If it looks too good to be true, don't buy it.

Always stick to name brands like SanDisk, you can find name-brand SD cards on these marketplaces, but sometimes these can be fake. If you are going to order from a marketplace site, make sure that you are buying from an official seller

!> Some stores *cough Walmart cough* have sold some of their marketplace items in store. Be careful, if it's cheap and high capacity, it's probably fake

#### Formatting your SD card

To format and test your micro SD card, I usually recommend the instructions found here: [https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html](https://dsi.cfw.guide/sd-card-setup.html)

### Recommended software

Here is the software that I would recommend installing before following the guide for your carts:

- [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) (Windows) - 7-Zip is a file archiver that is free and open source!
- [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) (MacOS) - File extractor for Mac OS, much better than Archive Utility in my opinion!
- [PeaZip](https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip/) (Windows/MacOS/Linux) - Similar to 7-Zip, PeaZip is a file archiver that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. While I prefer 7-Zip, PeaZip is also free and open source!

If you are using Linux, most of the time a file extractor will be included with your distro, I'd recommend using that instead

!> I do not recommend using WinRAR - yes, it's technically free as it doesn't force you to pay - why bother using it in the first place when there are better FOSS alternatives?

### Piracy Disclaimer

I have not, and will not, promote piracy on this site. This site is intended to set up your DS Flashcard, not to download ROMs. There are other sites dedicated to ROMs and Piracy. **This is not one of them**.

## Identifying your cart

Now we are onto the important section of this guide, identifying your cart.

A simple question, does your cart have a label with the manufacturer's website name on it?

- [Cart has a label with a website name](website.md)
- [Cart has a label without a website name](no_website.md)
- [No label or website name on the cart](no_label.md)

## Dates

Dates will be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY

## Cart Recommendations in 2023

If you are looking to buy a DS Flashcart, I recommend looking at the DS Quick Start Guide over on r/flashcarts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/ds-quick-start-guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/ds-quick-start-guide)

This will tell you what is and what isn't recommended to buy, it should help you pick out a cart that will work for you!

> If you are using a DSi or 3DS, I wouldn't recommend buying a flashcard. Instead, install custom firmware following these guides:

* [https://dsi.cfw.guide](https://dsi.cfw.guide) - This is a guide on installing Twilight Menu ++ and unlaunch onto your DSi
* [https://3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) - This is a guide on installing luma3ds and other necessary software for the 3DS - To play DS games, you should either download Twilight Menu ++, or an nds forwarder pack + nds-bootstrap.

Not only that, installing custom firmware removes flashcard blocks meaning that if you have an old DS Flashcard that does not work on your console, it should bypass the block and allow you to use it again! This also lets you use the better two carts (Acekard 2i clones/DSOne clones) on the quick start guide as well if you still want to buy a cart

Did I mention that custom firmware is free? :)
